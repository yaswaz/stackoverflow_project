### PROJECT MOTIVATION
The questions asked in this post were motivated by what I wanted to learn about the field of Data science before going into it. As someone who has worked all his life in the construction industry, considering a career change to Data science looked quite daunting. I had to go through a lot of articles and internet pages to get the information that was mostly opinion pieces. All I wanted to know at the time was what does the data say?
So it is my hope that the questions I attempt to answer here will help someone starting out in the field of Data Science.

### FILE DESCRIPTIONS
1. The data used for analysis post is the 2019 Stackoverflow survey downloaded directly from the website in CSV format. You can find the file here https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey
2. The schema with the questions asked in the survey is also included in CSV format also downloaded from stackoverflow website.
3. A file containing countries and continents was also used and attached
4. The jupyter notebook contains the code required to prepare, run and visualize the data and answer the questions asked. The Observations parts within the notebook summarize my insights from the analysis. All visualizations used in the Medium post are generated from this notebook.


### RESULTS
The finding of the analysis can be found in the Observation section of each part. There is also a medium post available here https://medium.com/@yasirwaziri/7-reasons-that-will-make-you-want-to-become-a-data-scientist-6a0fd457f36b that explains the insights.
